# Strada

[Strada](https://strada.hotwired.dev) enables you to create native controls in your hybrid mobile apps, driven by the web. Build web components and native components that work together in `WebView` screens to elevate your [Turbo Native](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/native) apps to the next level.

Strada works seamlessly with your [Turbo Native](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/handbook/native) apps and leverages [Stimulus]((https://stimulus.hotwired.dev)) to create web components with your existing HTML. The `strada-web` library is designed to work together with the [strada-ios](https://github.com/hotwired/strada-ios) and [strada-android](https://github.com/hotwired/strada-android) native libraries.
